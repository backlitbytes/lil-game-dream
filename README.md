Can you find all the games that let you find all the games?

Future things:

- performance issue all of the sudden!
- buttons releasing isn't working right with multiple presses
- move the carts... maybe to the bottom of the screen
- carts should enter with an animation + noise
- punch it all up
- unlocked carts in local storage (so folks don't need to repeat on refresh)
- sound effects (mostly of the game pad clicks)
- metadata (so sharing this looks nice)
