Can you find all the games that let you find all the games?

Share Blocking:

- buttons releasing isn't working right with multiple presses
- punch it all up
- sound effects (mostly of the game pad clicks)
- metadata (turn back on server rendering??) (so sharing this looks nice)

Future things:

- touch should probably work by entering the button area and leaving the button area - which may be a big PITA
